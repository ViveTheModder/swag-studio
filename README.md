# swag-studio
Swag Studio is a Budokai Tenkaichi 3 tool made for GSC files (Dragon History scenarios) to display basic information about them.
Currently, it displays the following:
* what conditions there are, and what scenes they lead to;
* what Z-Items are equipped/removed during a specific scene;
* what health or ki bonuses there may or may not be present;
* what events occur, and what characters they use (if any).

To ensure the program works, it comes with a vanilla copy of the Common Enemy GSC file (GSC-B-0.gsc).

## Known Issues
* As of now, this program is command-line only.
* I cannot get a proper runnable JAR release of the program because of certain issues with Eclipse's export feature.
  Because of that, there are no download/build instructions provided.
  TL;DR: Guilty as charged, skill issue on my part.
